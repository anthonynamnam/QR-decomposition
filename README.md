## Instruction

- Matrix.py contains the Matrix Class and the function of QR Decomposition.
- All functions below return Q & R matrix in a tuple.
  - QR_GS for QR Decomposition by classical Gram-Schmidt Process
  - QR_MGS for QR Decomposition by Modified Gram-Schmidt Process
  - QR_Householder for QR Decomposition by Householder Transformation
  - QR_GivensRotations for QR Decomposition by Givens Rotations [To be uploaded Soon]
- Run main.py to output the QR Decomposition example with both process.
