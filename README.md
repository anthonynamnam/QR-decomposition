## Instruction

- Matrix.py contains the Matrix Class and the function of QR Decomposition.
- Function QR_GS and QR_MGS are the functions for QR Decomposition by Gram-Schmidt Process and Modified Gram-Schmidt Process respectively. Both functions return Q & R matrix in a tuple.
- Run main.py to output the QR Decomposition example with both process.
